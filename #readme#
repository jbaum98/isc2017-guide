This repository is broken up into 2 main directories.
As the names suggest, the latex directory contains files
relating to LaTeX, while matlab contains files relating
to MATLAB.

latex dir:


matlab dir:
The most important file to pay attention to in the
matlab directory is the file 'reference.mlx'.
This is an expanded guide to MATLAB that covers topics
more in-depth than we can cover in our presentation.
However, remember that MATLAB is well documented! We
have covered a select few subjects that we think
are particularly useful. Think of this file first as a
reference for when you are a MATLAB beginner and later
as a jumping off point to guide your foray into
the world of more advanced MATLAB programming.
We will be uploading the solutions to the problems we
did in the MATLAB session sometime in the near future.
