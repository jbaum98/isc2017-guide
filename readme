This repository is broken up into 2 main directories.
As the names suggest, the latex directory contains files
relating to LaTeX, while matlab contains files relating
to MATLAB.

latex dir:
Within the latex directory, there are 3 things that you
should pay attention to. First, the simple directory
contains all the code and associated files to produce a
simple lab report. The complex directory contains a
more complex example. You can look at the pdfs within
each directory to see the final result.
The third thing to pay attention to is the lab.cls.
This is a package written by Jake Waksbaum to implement
a 'lab' documentclass. You can see how he uses it in
the example labs.

matlab dir:
The most important file to pay attention to in the
matlab directory is the file 'reference.mlx'.
This is an expanded guide to MATLAB that covers topics
more in-depth than we can cover in our presentation.
However, remember that MATLAB is well documented! We
have covered a select few subjects that we think
are particularly useful. Think of this file first as a
reference for when you are a MATLAB beginner and later
as a jumping off point to guide your foray into
the world of more advanced MATLAB programming.
