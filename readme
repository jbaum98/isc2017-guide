This repository is broken up into 2 main directories.
As the names suggest, the latex directory contains files
relating to LaTeX, while matlab contains files relating
to MATLAB.

latex dir:
Within the latex directory, there are 4 things that you
should pay attention to. First, the directory
'basic_example' contains a simple example of a latex file
and some of the basic commands and environment you will
need to know to write LaTeX documents. Opening the code,
which is contained in the file 'example.tex', next to
the PDF is the most effective way to learn the basics.
Second, the simple directory contains all the code and
associated files to produce a simple lab report. The
complex directory contains a more complex example.
You can look at the pdfs within each directory to see
the final result. The fourth thing to pay attention to
is the lab.cls. This is a package written by Jake
Waksbaum to implement a 'lab' documentclass.
You can see how he uses it in the example labs.

matlab dir:
The most important file to pay attention to in the
matlab directory is the file 'reference.mlx'.
This is an expanded guide to MATLAB that covers topics
more in-depth than we can cover in our presentation.
However, remember that MATLAB is well documented! We
have covered a select few subjects that we think
are particularly useful. Think of this file first as a
reference for when you are a MATLAB beginner and later
as a jumping off point to guide your foray into
the world of more advanced MATLAB programming.
We will be uploading the solutions to the problems we
did in the MATLAB session sometime in the near future.
